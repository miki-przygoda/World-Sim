# World Simulator

A Python-based celestial body simulator that models gravitational interactions between planets, stars, and other space objects.

## Features
- Simulates gravitational interactions between multiple bodies
- Real-time visualization using PyGame
- Configurable physical parameters (mass, velocity, position)
- Accurate physics calculations using Newton's laws of gravitation

## Installation
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the simulation:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls
- Space: Pause/Resume simulation
- Mouse Click: Add new celestial body
- ESC: Exit simulation
